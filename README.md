# Run-macOS-Stardew-Without-Mods
An automator app to launch the Steam version of Stardew Valley for macOS without mods.

If you have SMAPI installed for mods, it can be annoying to manually disable mods on macOS.

Running this should launch the game's original binary, bypassing mod loading without any config changes needed.

This is for the Steam version and should work if Stardew is installed in the default location.

Not heavily tested; ymmv. Enjoy.
